#summary Description of workflows in JANUS

= Workflows =
JANUS uses workflow to control the evolution of an entity. The different
states an entiy can be in is defined by the option `workflowstates` in the
configuration file. The syntax is as following:

{{{
'STATEKEY' => array(
    'name' => 'STATENAME',
    'description' => 'STATEDESCRIPTION'
),
}}}

The `STATEKEY` is userdefined and is only used as an internal key. The
`STATENAME` is a human readable name for the state and is the information
presented to the users. The `STATEDESCRIPTION` is a description of the meaning of the state. This information is also displayed to the user.

The state transitions is defined in the option `workflow_states`. The syntax
for defining state transitions is as following:

{{{
'STARTSTATE' => array(
    'ENDSTATE' => array(
        'role' => array(
	    'USERTYPE',
	),
    ),
    'ENDSTATE' => array(
	'role' => array(
	    'USERTYPE',
	),
    ),
    ...
),
}}}

You can define multiple endstates to allow for different workflows. `USERTYPE` uses the same syntax as for access permissions.
