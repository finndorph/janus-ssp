How to set up JANUS
===================

To set up JANUS you need to do the following:

  * Set up the Mailtoken authsource (See seperate documentation)
  * Set up database
  * Configure JANUS

Most of the three steps can be accomplished by running the install script
locates in the <janus-dir>/www/install/ folder. The script will create all
necessary tables in your database (if your are using MySQL). It will also
generate a config file, that you will need to copy manually to
<ssp-dir>/config/ as well as a config string for the Mailtoken authsource
which you have to copy to <ssp-dir>/config/authsources.php.

If you do not want to use the install script, you can find the necessary SQL
code in the file janus.sql located in the <janus-dir>/doc folder and
a config file in <janus-dir>/config-template folder.

To setup the Mailtoken authsource see seperate documentation in the
<janus-dir>/docs folder. You can use other authsources, but you probably
need to tweek JANUS a bit. JANUS is setup to use e-mail adresses as user
dentifiers, but should work with other user identifiers.

The last thing you need to do is to edit the config file. If you have used
the install script, you only need to enter the metadatafields you allow.
